# Tennis Refactoring Kata

This is my attempt to the C# version of Emily Bache's [Tennis Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata)

There are three versions of this refactoring kata, each with their own design smells and challenges : TennisGame1, TennisGame2, TennisGame3.

I did focused on the **TennisGame2** for the moment.


## Approach

For this refactoring, I focused on working through Baby Steps changes. Small changes every time, ensuring that test runs correctly after each update.
